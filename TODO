- Truth
- Factory
- FLTK interface
- GPS 
- WiFi

- Write install instructions
- Write keyboard mappings
- Quick HOWTO
- Write a tutorial for creating custom models
- Write a tutorial for creating new controllers

- Write a tutorial for creating a new world

- BSP loader
- Multilevel map extruder

- Use dCylinder and dCapsule ODE objects
- Add spring force between bodies of a model to keep the together. See ODE example test_joints.cpp

-run gprof, and valgrind

- Hand of god
  - Select models and get info
  - Move models
- Better fonts
- reorganize the Media
- Better camera movement. Translate is too slow over long distances

-Fog
- Anti Aliasing
- Threading. Make use of dual-core machines.
- Implement triggers with callbacks.

- Better lights
  - GLSL per pixel lighting. Make this user selectable.

- Pick a formatting standard for XML file
- Dynamic textures
- Scripting interface for models and sensors
- Google Earth API interface
- Check laser sampling rate
- Standardize internal API
- Data Logger
- Replace all return int, with throws
- The bodies set their scenenode based on a global pose. They should set their scenenodes based a pose relative to the model. The model currently doesn't move it's scene node, so it's always at (0,0,0). Basically should make all Body Pose stuff relative to the parent.
-Allow person to display and change XML parameters through the GUI.
-Look into COLLADA, OPAL, Bullet Physics & Collisioin detection engine
-Add "Angle" class, will handle ROTD and DTOR.
-Templatize Vector, Quaternion, Pose


Completed:
- Laser and Camera Interfaces
- Pose3d Interface. Thanks Toby
- Lights, and global ambient
- Enable/disable sky box, and set material
- New Coordinate system
- Pause and step simulation
- Set the screen size
- Toggle HUD display using tab
- Help overlay
- Show simTime, realTime, pauseTime
- XML include
- Check for player.
- Trimesh
