- The bodies set their scenenode based on a global pose. They should set their scenenodes based a pose relative to the model. The model currently doesn't move it's scene node, so it's always at (0,0,0). Basically should make all Body Pose stuff relative to the parent.
-Allow person to display and change XML parameters through the GUI.
-Look into COLLADA, OPAL, Bullet Physics & Collisioin detection engine
-Add "Angle" class, will handle ROTD and DTOR.
-Templatize Vector, Quaternion, Pose
