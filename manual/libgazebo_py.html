/** @page libgazebo_py Python bindings (libgazebo_py)

Python bindings for libgazebo are generated automatically using <a
href="http://swig.com">SWIG</a>.  The bindings are object-oriented,
using standard Python classes (for those familiar with SWIG, these are
standard SWIG shadow classes).  Refer to the @ref libgazebo_usage "libgazebo instructions" 
for general information on how to use this library.


@section libgazebo_py_usage General usage

Programs using the libgazebo Python bindings will generally have the
following structure:

@include sinusoid.py

The steps in this program mirror those described for <a
href="index.html">standard C program</a>.  The key syntactical
difference between the C-version and the Python version is the use of
Python's object-oriented features.

This example can be demonstrated using the follow world file:

@include sinusoid.world


@section libgazebo_py_ref Proxy reference

Generally speaking, the Python bindings are one-to-one mappings to the
libgazebo API.  Thus, the C documentation can be used as a guide, so
long as one makes some minor mental translations; e.g.:

@verbatim
pos = gz_position_alloc(...);    ->   pos = gz_position(...)
gz_position_open(pos, ...);      ->   pos.open(...)
@endverbatim

Detailed information for each C proxy can be found in the <a
href="modules.html">Reference</a> section.
