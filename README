Gazebo - A dynamic multi-robot simulator
---------------------------------------- 

This is the Gazebo simulator.  Gazebo simulates multiple robots in a
3D environment, with extensive dynamic interaction between objects.
Gazebo was developed at the USC Robotics Research Lab as part of the
Player/Stage project, and is fully compatible at with the Player robot
device server.  Gazebo is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
and can be downloaded from the Player/Stage homepage:

  http://playerstage.sourceforge.net


Installation
------------
Read INSTALL for generic instructions.  For most people, the following
sequence will suffice:

  $ scons install


3rd Party Libraries
------------------
Gazebo uses the following libraries:

  Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal
  OpenDynamicsEngine (ODE) http://opende.sourceforge.net

ODE is mandatory. GDAL is required only for specific features
such as the MapExtruder and Terrain models, but is highly recommended.
