/** \mainpage Gazebo API Reference


Gazebo is a multi-robot simulator for both indoor and outdoor
environments.  It is capable of simulating a population of
robots, sensors and objects, but does so in a three-dimensional
world. It generates realistic sensor feedback, object collisions and
dynamics.
