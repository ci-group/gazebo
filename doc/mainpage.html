/** @mainpage Gazebo


Gazebo is a multi-robot simulator for both indoor and outdoor
environments.  Like Stage, it is capable of simulating a population of
robots, sensors and objects, but does so in a three-dimensional
world. It generates realistic sensor feedback, object collisions and
dynamics.

Gazebo is normally used in conjunction with the Player device server;
Player provides an abstracted, network-centric mechanism (a server)
through which robot controllers (clients) can interact with robot
hardware. When used with Gazebo, Player provides @e simulated data in
the place of real sensor data.  In principle, client programs cannot
tell the difference between real devices and the Gazebo simulation of
those devices.

Gazebo can also be controlled through a low-level C API (libgazebo).
This library is included to allow third-party developers to easily
integrate Gazebo into their own (non-Player) servers or architectures.

Installation instructions for Gazebo can be found @ref install "here".


@section mainpage_usage Quick-start guide

The Gazebo server can be started as follows:

@verbatim
$ gazebo <xmlfile>
@endverbatim

where <tt>xmlfile</tt> is an XML configuration file containing the description of the world and everything in it.  Sample world files can be found in
the <tt>worlds</tt> directory of the source distribution, or in the
installed version under <tt>/usr/local/share/gazebo/worlds/</tt>
(default install).  For example:
@verbatim
$ gazebo /usr/local/share/gazebo/worlds/pioneer2dx.world
@endverbatim
will create a simple world with a single robot.  Gazebo will display a
window with a view of the simulated world; the camera viewpoint can be
changed by dragging the mouse in the window.


@section mainpage_player Working with Player (optional)

The Player device server treats Gazebo in exactly the same way that it
treats real robot hardware: as a device that is a source of data and a
sink for commands.  Users must therefore run Player seperately, and
point it at an running instance of Gazebo.  Player has a number of
specific drivers, such as %gz_position and %gz_laser that can be used
to interact with Gazebo models.

For example, after starting Gazebo as per the above example, run
Player like this:

@verbatim
$ player /usr/local/share/player/config/gazebo.cfg
@endverbatim

Player will output a message indicating that is has connected with the
simulator:

@verbatim
libgazebo msg : opening /tmp/gazebo-<username>-default-sim-default
@endverbatim

Users can now interact with the simulated robot exactly as they would a
real robot.  Try running <tt>playerv</tt>, for example:

@verbatim
$ playerv --position:0 --laser:0
@endverbatim

This will pop up the standard Player viewer utility.  You should see
an outline of the robot and the laser scan.  Use the mouse to pan and
zoom.  You can drive the robot around by selecting the "command"
option from the menu, then dragging the little cross hairs to where
you want the robot to go.  You should see the the robot in the Gazebo
window moving at the same time.

See @ref player for examples of typical Player/Gazebo configurations,
and consult the Player manual for information on specific Player
drivers.
