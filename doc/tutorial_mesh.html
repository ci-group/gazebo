@page tutorial_mesh Mesh Creation Tutorial

This page describes how to create your own custom meshes, for use in Gazebo. Only Blender (www.blender.org) is covered, although other packages such as Maya and 3DStudio can be used.

\section Create your mesh

This is the easy part. Just fire up Blender, and start modeling. There are a few tricks to keep in mind when the time comes to export your model to Ogre.

1. You can only export a single mesh.
2. Move the mesh to the origin.
3. Make sure the scale of the mesh is set to 1.0 for all three dimensions.
     This is important to prevent weird skew problems.


\section Export your mesh

You'll need the Ogre exporter, which is found here:
http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/OGRE_Meshes_Exporter

Place the Python script in Blender's script directory, which should be 
@verbatim
/usr/share/blender/scripts
@endverbatim

In blender open the Scripts view, and select "Export" from the menu options. Select the mesh you want to export, and the path, and select the OgreXMLConverter option.

\section Let Gazebo Know

The final step is to move your mesh into Gazebo's models directory, which is located:
@verbatim
<install_path>/share/gazebo/Media/models
@endverbatim

Now you can include your mesh in your world file.
