@page install Installation (Linux)

Gazebo relies on a number of third-party libraries that make
installation a little bit tricky.  If things go wrong, please check
the archives of the Gazebo <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=33909">mailing
list</a>.  Please read the instructions below @b carefully before
reporting posting to the mailing list.

<b> These are the Linux installation instructions, OS X users should
go @ref install_osx "here". </b>


@section install_required Required 3rd Party Libraries

The the GUI component of Gazebo is designed to allow users to integrate their favorite GUI libraries with Gazebo. FLTK is the default GUI, which can be found at:
- <a href="http://www.fltk.org">FLTK</a> (Fast Light Toolkit).

Visual display of Gazebo is accomplished using the OGRE rendering engine. This software library can be installed from:
- <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">OGRE</a> (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine).

To simulate rigid body physics, Gazebo utilizes ODE. Gazebo requires that ODE support trimeshes. A default install of ODE should enable trimesh suppport, if in doubt check the help files found in the ODE sources.
- <a href="http://www.ode.org">ODE</a> (Open Dynamics Engine)

User input is gathered using OIS:
- <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wgois">OIS</a> (Object Oriented Input System)

Gazebo requires an xml configuration file to be specified at runtime. We use libxml2 to handle parsing this configuration file:
- <a href="http://xmlsoft.org">libxml2</a>(XML C parser)

\section install_optional Optional 3rd party libraries

Player provides a convient mechanism to control the various models and sensors withing Gazebo. If Player is installed, then Gazebo will build a plugin for Player.
- <a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net">Player</a>

\section install_prepare Preparing your system

The default install path for many source packages (Gazebo included) is:
@verbatim
/usr/local
/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/include
/usr/local/lib
@endverbatim

In some Linux distributions, however, these paths are not searched by
default, leading to problems when compiling and linking some packages.
We therefore recommend that you configure your system with some
additional paths (added to your .bashrc script, for example):

@verbatim
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export CPATH=/usr/local/include:$CPATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
@endverbatim

The first line sets the executable path; the second sets the path for
C and C++ header files; the third line sets the library search path.
You will also need to set two more paths:

@verbatim
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
@endverbatim 

This line sets the pkg-config path (a neat utility for mananging
source dependencies).


@section install_ Global Installation (requires root access)

@verbatim
$ tar xvzf gazebo-<version>.tar.gz
$ cd gazebo-<version>
$ scons
@endverbatim
Note that scons will fail if any of the required packages are missing.
Once Gazebo has been built, it can be installed: 
@verbatim
$ su
$ scons install
$ exit
@endverbatim

Gazebo is now ready to run; try:
@verbatim
$ gazebo /usr/local/share/gazebo/worlds/pioneer.world
@endverbatim

@section install_local Local installation (does not require root access)

Some developers prefer to install Gazebo in our home directory (e.g.,
/home/[username]/local) rather than in a system directory.  This is
useful if you are working on shared machines and/or lack root access.
Naturally, local installs can make it a bit tricky for Gazebo (and
other packages) to find the right headers, libs and so on.  Here,
then, is the recommended way to do it:
 
- Pick a spot for "local" installs; for me it is
 "/home/[username]/local".  The install scripts will create relevant
 subdirs under this, such as:
@verbatim
/home/[username]/local/bin
/home/[username]/local/include
/home/[username]/local/lib
@endverbatim
 
- Set up the necessary compiler paths in your .bashrc (or whatever)
  script; e.g.:
@verbatim
export PATH=~/local/bin:$PATH
export CPATH=~/local/include:$CPATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=~/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
@endverbatim
The first line sets the executable path; the second sets the path for C
and C++ header files; the third line sets the library search path.
 
- Set up some additional paths in your .bashrc (or whatever):
@verbatim
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=~/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
@endverbatim 
This line sets the pkg-config path (for applications using
pkg-config, which will be everything in the Player/Stage/Gazebo
project pretty soon)

- Build and install Gazebo using the "prefix" argument:
@verbatim
$ scons prefix=/home/[username]/local install
@endverbatim

Everything should now work seamlessly, and your locally installed
packages will be used in preference to any system-wide defaults.
