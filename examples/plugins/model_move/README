Model Movement Plugin

This is a simple plugin example for moving a model to a specified set of goal points.

The displacement is not kinematic aware, it uses the Pose Animation as described in
the tutorial: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=animated_box 

===================
Build Instructions
===================

* From this directory

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make

=================
Run Instructions
=================

* From this directory

$ gazebo model_move.world
 
* In a seperate session

$ cd build
$ ./path_publisher

To change the input parameters, you can modify the world file sdf:

    <path> is the sequence of goal point, as a string of space-separated integers, six ints per point as per gazebo Pose.
    <n_points> is the number of specified goal points.

    Example (in sdf file):
    
    <plugin name="model_move" filename="libmodel_move.so"/>
        <path>5 5 0 0 0 0
              5 -5 0 0 0 0
              0 0 0 0 0 0</path>
	<n_points>3</n_points>

Input parameters can also be sent via gazebo topics. This example uses path_publisher.cc to send path information to the movement plugin via a PoseAnimation message. See file for more details.
