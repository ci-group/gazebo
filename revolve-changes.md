# Changes to Gazebo on this branch
- Fixes the transport library error, see 
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/821/apparent-transport-race-condition-on
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1720/race-condition-in-transport-library
- Fixes the empty message error, see:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1722/empty-message-types-caused-by-entity-fini
- Implements a workaround for model delete race condition, see:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1739/race-condition-when-deleting-a-model
- Adds a fix for the contact sensor race condition:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1740/race-condition-when-deleting-contactsensor
- Changing `Base::parent` to a weak pointer:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1142/potential-for-smart-pointer-reference
- Introducing `ODEModel` in order to track a model's collision space in ODE, currently it is not
  removed adequately:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1780/ode-collision-space-not-deleted-when-model
- Changing the parent / child joint lists in `Link` to use weak pointers to prevent circular
  references (no issue yet).
- Changing `Joint::model` to use a weak pointer to prevent circular references.
- Changing `JointControllerPrivate::model` to use a weak pointer to prevent circular references.
- Removing call to `parent_->RemoveChild()` to fix memory leak as suggested in:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1786/invalid-access-of-base-children-results-in
- Storing the remote host/port of the original "advertise" request when creating a PublicationTransport, so the URLs actually match when checking for a previously existing one (YET TO REPORT THIS ISSUE)
- Fixing `ContactManager::RemoveFilter()` to be consistent with `CreateFilter()`:
 https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1805/contactmanager-createfilter-and
- Removing a `Publisher`'s Publication::prevMsg when it is deleted in `Publication::RemovePublisher`, preventing
  iteration over a bunch of messages of publishers that are long gone.
  CREATE ISSUE
- Cleaning up `TopicManager::subscribedNodes` when a node unsubscribes a topic, so no long list of empty
  maps can potentially remain.
  CREATE ISSUE
- Fixes model bounding boxes:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1325/getboundingbox-returns-the-models-last%20is%20fixed
- Fixing `CameraSensor` segmentation faults, possibly related:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1470/gzclient-segmentation-fault-on-exit-when-a
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1680/segmentation-fault-in-gzclient-with-camera
  CREATE ISSUE?
- Fixing `CameraSensor`s creating identically named cameras in the scene
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1811/scene-camera-name-clashes-when-using
- Fixing `AxisVisual` arrows not being removed from scene when deleting model
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1812/arrows-of-axisvisual-are-never-removed
- Fixing creation of redundant Joint visuals:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1816/multiple-redundant-jointvisual-s-created
